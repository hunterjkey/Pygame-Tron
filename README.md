# Pygame-Tron
Tron written using the Pygame library!

# Installation for Pygame:
Note: This tutorial is made for python 3.6, some steps may be different if another version of Python is used

1) Download Python 3.6.0
 ```
download it from https://www.python.org/
Make sure to check “save to path.” Just click “next” for the rest of it. Remember where Python is stored though because you will need to access it
 ```

2) Download pygame
 ```
Go to https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy
Select and download the file called “pygit2‑0.26.3‑cp36‑cp36m‑win32.whl”
Remember the location (directory) of this file. It will likely store itself under C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads. 
 ```
3) Update pip and wheel
 ``` 
Open the command line
go to where Python 3 is stored
Check your versions of pip and wheel
Check that pip is installed by typing “python -m ensurepip” and then upgrade it using “python –m ensurepip –upgrade”
Install Wheel by typing “pip3 install wheel.” (the pip3 is to ensure that we install through Python 3, instead of Python 2)
If it says the requirement is already satisfied, type “pip install wheel –upgrade”
If these commands bring up errors, like it did for me on the class computers, then don’t bother, just continue with the next steps. It probably means that these components of the installation don’t need any updating.

4) Install pygame through the command line
 ```
Navigate to the directory that holds your pygame installation.
Use the command “pip3 install pygit2‑0.26.3‑cp36‑cp36m‑win32.whl” to download pygame
 ```

5) Use Pygame with Python 3
 ```
Search up “Python” in the search bar in the bottom left corner of your screen
Select and run “IDLE” (this is an acronym for Integrated Development and Learning Environment, we are going to use this instead of a virtual environment)
Select “File” and then “New File” and a window will appear that looks like notepad, your python code will be written here.
Write a Python Program, go to http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?lang=en for information on making python games
When you want to run a program simply click “Run” and then “Run Module”
 ```
